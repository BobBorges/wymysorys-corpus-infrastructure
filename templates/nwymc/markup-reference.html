Anyone can create a marked up, plain-text version of a document; on submission of a finished markup to the corpus, it will be read by a script that will deposit various parts of the text into the corpus database in a correctly structured way. In other words, markup saves users of the corpus the trouble of having to understand and/or mess with the underlying database. This document describes the markup conventions associated with this corpus.' %}</p>

Paragraph is a subdivision of a complete text. Fragment is a subdivision of a Paragraph. In the database, Paragraph objects are really just containers for Fragments – there is not text in a Paragraph by itself; all text is contained within a Fragment object. Aside from Paragraphs and Fragments, nothing else matters! The database doesn&#39;t care about sections, pages, sentences, lines or whatever...' %}</p>

In the corpus markup, a paragraph sits on a single numbered line; if a paragraph is longer than the window it will be wrapped and the next numbered line will be pushed down to make space (see image). In poetry / song lyrics, by convention, the markup used here groups a stanza together as a paragraph. See the "Simple Formatting" subsection about inserting line breaks.' %} </li>

As mentioned above, in the database text is actually all stored in Fragment objects and by default a Paragraph will contain one Fragment unless there is some tag in the markup to trigger the close of one and opening of another Fragment within the paragraph. Since the corpus handles multilingual texts by design, the main function of fragments is to differentiate languages in multilingual text (see "Text Language" section). Setting a new language within a line of markup automatically causes program to end the current Fragment and begin a new Fragment. In general Monolingual Paragraph objects will contain just one Fragment. It is also possible to force a new Fragment without setting a new language using  &lt;ENDFRAGMENT/&gt;; this is handy only when there would be multiple Marginal Comments associated with a single fragment (since the parser only allows one Marginal text object per fragment... see the "Marginal Text" section below).' %}</li>

We mark page breaks within fragments using &lt;br/&gt;. Poetry and song lyrics are obvious cases where line breaks are meaningful; in these cases a stanza is marked up as paragraph (i.e. on a single line in the markup editor) and line breaks are indicated with the &lt;br/&gt; tag. Since we generally might not realize when line breaks are meaningful (unless you are marking up a text that you authored yourself) we indicate breaks wherever they occur within the text. Between words, &lt;br/&gt; should be adjacent to the following word with a space before &mdash; "between &lt;br/&gt;words".

Use pages of the asset, not the numbered pages in the document &ndash; often in PDF documents the numbered pages do not match the page of the file.) Like line breaks, we mark page breaks where they fall, right in the text if a page breaks across a fragment.
